All BOSC posters will be displayed for the two days of BOSC (July 22-23).  ISMB requests that the presenters of even-numbered posters stand by their posters the first day, and odd-numbered poster presenters stand by their posters on the second day. Your poster must be no more than 0.95 m wide x 1.30 m high.

Poster abstracts can be found in the complete program (available soon).
