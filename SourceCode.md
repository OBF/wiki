# Anonymous access to the latest hosted source code repositories

The methods described here grant access to live snapshots of our current
code repositories. The files may be in constant flux and certainly do
not reflect official packages and supported releases.

The following OBF supported projects are now using git hosted on
[github.com](http://github.com):

`   * `[`BioRuby`](http://www.bioruby.org)` uses `[`http://github.com/bioruby/bioruby`](http://github.com/bioruby/bioruby)  
`   * `[`Biopython`](http://www.biopython.org)` uses `[`http://github.com/biopython/biopython`](http://github.com/biopython/biopython)  
`   * `[`BioPerl`](http://www.bioperl.org)` uses `[`http://github.com/bioperl`](http://github.com/bioperl)  
`   * `[`BioSQL`](http://www.biosql.org)` uses `[`http://github.com/biosql/biosql`](http://github.com/biosql/biosql)

For downloads of tested and released software, please visit the official
[Projects](Projects "wikilink") page for links to the project websites
and download locations.

## Note to developers

This page describes methods for obtaining **read only** access to the
latest snapshots of our source code. Updates, fixes and new code **can
not** be committed, but you can create a
[fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) of the repository
on github (allowing you to modify you own personal repository), and
changes resubmitted to the projects as a [pull
request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

## Past archives

The above projects have previously used CVS and/or SVN hosted on
OBF-maintained hardware, but these resources are no longer available.
