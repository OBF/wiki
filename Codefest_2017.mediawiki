title: Codefest 2017
---

OpenBio Codefest 2017 is July 20th and 21st, 2017 (the Thursday and Friday before [[BOSC 2017]] and the ISMB/ECCB 2017 meeting) at [https://brmlab.cz/ Brmlab: a non-profit, community-run hackerspace in Prague].

This is an opportunity for anyone interested in open science, biology and programming to meet, discuss and work collaboratively. Everyone is welcome to attend. We will have a mix of experienced developers, newcomers to bioinformatics and everything in between.

This is the eight annual pre-[[BOSC]] [[Codefest]]. Previous fun and successful events were [[Codefest 2010]] in
Boston, [[Codefest 2011]] in Vienna, [[Codefest 2012]] in Los Angeles, [[Codefest 2013]] in Berlin,
and [[Codefest 2014]] in Boston, [[Codefest 2015]] in Dublin and [[Codefest 2016]] in Orlando.

== Objectives ==

The goal of Codefest is to bring open source bioinformatics programmers together to have an enjoyable and productive two days. Practically this results in a number of useful outcomes:

* Improving and expanding existing open source code, documentation and infrastructure (see the summaries from [https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Codefest_2016#Outcomes Codefest 2016], [https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Codefest_2015#Outcomes Codefest 2015], [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/114yvrK0Veasc_ns_rg484j2xxRi1h7wNlU2XKONuUqY/edit Codefest 2014] and [http://bcb.io/2013/07/18/summary-from-bioinformatics-open-science-codefest-2013-tools-infrastructure-standards-and-visualization/ Codefest 2013] for examples of work accomplished in previous years).

* Developing new communities working on shared problems. For example, the [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/common-workflow-language Common Workflow Language] developed from discussions at Codefest 2014.

* Establishing new friendships, helping to expand the open source bioinformatics community.

* Preparing and publishing [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/S14/S7 papers about the work accomplished].

== Why attend ==

* For new members of the community: meet and learn with other open source programmers. There are [https://docs.google.com/document/d/16OKzgx11VLLvvxzXlhDr8yPQ8gFYg61bfbes79qPJE8/edit?usp=sharing projects specifically for new attendees, or add your own ideas]. 

* For current community members: expand your network and strengthen existing relationships. Teach and learn from new community members. Focus on open source work without interruptions. Discuss questions and problems in real time. 

* For everyone: discuss and learn from the community. Teach others what you know. Build new friendships and collaborations.

If you have any questions or thoughts, please get in touch with [https://github.com/chapmanb Brad] directly, in the [https://gitter.im/chapmanb/obf-codefest Gitter chat room] or on the [https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openbio-codefest-2017 Codefest 2017 mailing list].

== What to expect ==

The OpenBio Codefest is a collaborative two day working session. The only
requirement for attendance is that you have an interest in open source software
and solving scientific problems. We will have contributors to open source
bioinformatics tools present to collaboratively work with, and we welcome new
attendees who want to learn and contribute to open source code or documentation.

The rough structure of the two days is:

* Start with introductions from everyone attending about their goals and plans for the two days.

* Assemble into working groups based on shared interests like programming languages, open source projects or biological questions. We use the [https://docs.google.com/document/d/16OKzgx11VLLvvxzXlhDr8yPQ8gFYg61bfbes79qPJE8/edit?usp=sharing collaboratively brainstormed Google document] as the basis for setting up groups. Attendees determine the goals for the two days. If you have an idea for a project, please add it before the event. Any and all suggestions are welcome.

* Work and discuss. Enjoy the productive time.

* We'll have regular breaks where each group can deliver short reports on their progress.

* We have informal lunches, dinners and drinks as a way for everyone to get to know each other better.

* At the end of the two days, we summarize contributions and work accomplished in a BOSC presentation and meeting report.

Please feel free to get in touch with any of the organizers with questions. You
are very welcome at Codefest.

== Attending ==

You are very welcome to attend. There is no cost, we only ask you to register to help organize numbers. Please add yourself if you are
interested to [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o-eIxURNdYoCsrpMRYtzXygM8wMj96WN8zYTTpLhkSU/edit#gid=0 this Google spreadsheet]
We'll coordinate through the [https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openbio-codefest-2017 Codefest 2017 mailing list],
so please sign up to discuss and receive updates.

If you're not able to physically attend, we're still more than happy to have you participate in Codefest. Please sign up on the [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o-eIxURNdYoCsrpMRYtzXygM8wMj96WN8zYTTpLhkSU/edit#gid=0 the Google spreadsheet] and list yourself as remote only. We have a [https://gitter.im/chapmanb/obf-codefest Gitter chat room] we can use to coordinate and discuss in real time and will have an open Google Hangout to make it easier to be part of Codefest remotely.

Add your [https://docs.google.com/document/d/16OKzgx11VLLvvxzXlhDr8yPQ8gFYg61bfbes79qPJE8/edit?usp=sharing project ideas to the shared google document]. The ideas include smaller focused projects and larger work. We want suggestions from everyone and will organize into groups around these during Codefest.

== Logistics ==

Codefest is kindly hosted by [https://brmlab.cz/ Brmlab], a non-profit, community-run hackerspace in Prague.
