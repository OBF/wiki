## Open Data: Standards, Opportunities and Challenges

Every year, BOSC includes a panel discussion that offers attendees the
chance to engage in conversation with the panelists and each other. This
year, our panel discussion will focus on open data: how it can help to
catalyze scientific and preserve knowledge, standards for sharing data,
and some of the challenges (for example, protecting privacy of human
health data).
