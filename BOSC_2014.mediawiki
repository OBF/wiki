|The 15th Annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2013) will be held in Boston on July 11-12, right before ISMB 2014.

== Important Dates ==

* July 11-12, 2014: BOSC 2014, Boston, MA
* July 12-16, 2014: ISMB 2014, Boston, MA

== Overview ==

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is a two-day Special Interest Group of [http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2013 ISMB]. It is sponsored by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (O|B|F), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development within the biological research community. 

Open Source software has flourished in the bioinformatics community for well over a decade. When the first BOSC (Bioinformatics Open Source Conference) was held in 2000, there were already a number of popular open source bioinformatics packages, and the number and range of these projects has increased dramatically since then. BOSC covers the wide range of open source bioinformatics software packages that have been successfully developed and adopted by the community, and encompasses the growing movement of Open Science, with its focus on transparency, reproducibility, and data provenance. We welcome submissions relating to all aspects of open source bioinformatics software and open science, including new computational methods, reusable software components, visualization, interoperability, and other approaches that help to advance research in the biomolecular sciences. Two full days of talks, posters, panel discussions, and informal discussion groups will enable BOSC attendees to interact with other developers and share ideas and code, as well as learning about some of the latest developments in the field of open source bioinformatics.
