The '''B'''ioinformatics '''O'''pen '''S'''ource '''C'''onference is held annually as a Special Interest Group (SIG) of the [http://www.iscb.org/ ISCB's annual ISMB conference]. BOSC promotes and facilitates the [[wp:open source|open source]] development of [[wp:bioinformatics|bioinformatics]] tools and open science.  The aims of the conferences are to: 
# Provide developers with a forum for displaying the results of their development efforts to the wider research community; 
# Provide a focused environment for developers and users to interact and share ideas about software development, open science, and practical techniques in bioinformatics; 
# Promote Open Science, with its focus on sharing data and tools, transparency, reproducibility, and data provenance;
# Inform the research community of important developments occurring within the Open Source Bioinformatics Developer community.

== Sponsors ==

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation welcomes donations to help support our work and the BOSC meeting, including offering [https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/blob/master/Travel_fellowships.md Travel Fellowships] and registration fee waivers.

We currently request '''USD $1000 for sponsoring BOSC''', and will include your name and logo on the conference webpage, selected publicity material including blog posts and tweets, and during the conference itself during the opening and/or closing slides. Sponsors are welcome to submit work to be presented at BOSC as a talk or poster, but this will be reviewed impartially like any other submission.

We currently request '''USD $1500 for sponsoring BOSC and the Codefest''', or '''USD $500 for sponsoring the pre-BOSC Codefest only''', with similar publicity arrangements. Here some of the donation will directly fund lunch and refreshment for the Codefest participants. Sponsor's developer/technical staff are welcome to attend the Codefest.

We are open to discussing specific requests, such as distributing stickers or leaflets, or earmarking the sponsorship to a specific activity.
