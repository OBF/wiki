For 2018, the Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2018) and Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2018) are joining together for a unified event ([https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/ GCC BOSC 2018]) to be held in Portland, Oregon, United States, June 25-30, 2018.  

'''[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gccbosc2018 Submit your abstract now]''' (via EasyChair). When you go to the submission portal (EasyChair), you will be able to choose whether to submit your abstract to BOSC or GCC.
<br/>
== Important Dates ==
* '''March 16, 2018: Deadline for [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gccbosc2018 submitting one-page abstracts] for full talks'''
* April 10, 2018: Authors notified
* '''June 25-30, 2018: [https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/| GCCBOSC2018 (Portland, Oregon)]''' -- main conference June 27-28

== Acceptance Criteria ==

'''BOSC''' welcomes submissions about all aspects of open source bioinformatics, open science and open data, including but not limited to reproducible research, citizen/participatory science, standards and interoperability, open source tools for data science and visualization, and medical and translational bioinformatics. '''Work discussed in BOSC presentations must be open source''', with a recognized open source license and an URL for accessing your code. We look for impact of the work in building or sustaining open source communities.  We are happy to consider abstracts describing work that has already been published or presented elsewhere, but we ask you to mention that on the submission form. Work that has been presented at a recent BOSC will need to demonstrate significant progress in order to be eligible for a talk at BOSC 2018.

'''GCC''' welcomes submissions that use, implement, or extend the Galaxy platform and ecosystem, including but not limited to integrating and analyzing large and diverse datasets in biomedical research; enhancing reproducibility in computational analyses; and fostering collaboration and communication in scientific workflow development.

If your abstract PRIMARILY concerns Galaxy, please submit your abstract to the Galaxy track. If it is accepted for a talk, we will try to schedule your talk during a joint GCC/BOSC session.

== Abstract Formatting Requirements ==
Abstracts must be '''one page''' (8.5 inches by 11 inches or A4) in length and submitted '''as a PDF file'''. Your one-page abstract is welcome to include any figures or graphics that will fit; however, we cannot accept figures on additional page(s).

You may wish to use one of these abstract templates:
* [http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/File:BOSC2015-abstract-template.pdf PDF] (not fillable)
* [https://s3.amazonaws.com/chapmanb/openbio/bosc_template_pandoc.tar.gz Markdown to PDF] (convert with pandoc and LaTeX)
* [http://www.open-bio.org/bosc2015/bosc2015-abstract-example.doc Word (.doc)] 
* [http://www.open-bio.org/bosc2015/bosc2015-abstract-example.docx Word (.docx)]
* [http://www.open-bio.org/bosc2015/bosc2015-abstract-example.pages Pages]
* [https://github.com/bow/talks/blob/master/2014_bosc/abstract/abstract.tex LaTeX]

Please use one of the provided templates or format your abstract as follows:
* Use 1 inch (2.5 cm) margins on the top, sides, and bottom of the page.
* Include the following pieces of information in order from the top of the page:
** Title
** Authors, with the presenting author's name underlined.
** Author affiliations, including the e-mail address of the presenting author.
** URL for the overall project web site
** URL for accessing the code
** The particular Open Source License being used (for BOSC)

== BOSC Open Source License Requirement ==

The [[OBF|Open Bioinformatics Foundation]], which coordinates BOSC, is dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source Software Development within the biological research community. For this reason, if a submitted abstract concerns a specific software system for use by the research community, then that software must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be available for download, including source code, by a tar/zip file accessed through ftp/http or through a widely used version control system like cvs/subversion/git/bazaar/Mercurial.
