 In 2019, BOSC will be part of [https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2019 ISMB/ECCB] in Basel. We therefore need to follow ISMB's dates and procedures.

'''[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gccbosc2018 Submit your abstract now]''' (via EasyChair). When you go to the submission portal (EasyChair), you will be able to choose which COSI to submit to.

== Important Dates ==
* April 11, 2019: Abstract submission deadline
* May 9, 2019 Authors notified
* * '''July 24-25, 2019: BOSC 2019''',  Basel, Switzerland (as part of ISMB/ECCB 2019)

== Acceptance Criteria ==

BOSC welcomes submissions about all aspects of open source bioinformatics, open science and open data, including but not limited to reproducible research, citizen/participatory science, standards and interoperability, open source tools for data science and visualization, and medical and translational bioinformatics. '''Work discussed in BOSC presentations must be open source''', with a recognized open source license and a URL for accessing your code. We look for impact of the work in building or sustaining open source communities.  We are happy to consider abstracts describing work that has already been published or presented elsewhere, but we ask you to mention that on the submission form. Work that has been presented at a recent BOSC will need to demonstrate significant progress in order to be eligible for a talk at BOSC 2019.

== Abstract Formatting Requirements ==
Abstracts must be '''one page''' (8.5 inches by 11 inches or A4) in length and submitted '''as a PDF file'''. Your one-page abstract is welcome to include any figures or graphics that will fit; however, we cannot accept figures on additional page(s).

Please format your abstract as follows. Abstract PDFs will be included as-is in the program, so they need to include all the relevant information on that one page.
* Include the following pieces of information in order from the top of the page:
** Title
** Authors, with the presenting author's name underlined.
** Author affiliations, including the e-mail address of the presenting author.
** URL for the overall project web site
** URL for accessing the code
** The particular Open Source License being used (for BOSC)
* Use 1 inch (2.5 cm) margins on the top, sides, and bottom of the page, and a font size of 11 or 12.

== BOSC Open Source License Requirement ==

The [[OBF|Open Bioinformatics Foundation]], which coordinates BOSC, is dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source Software Development within the biological research community. For this reason, if a submitted abstract concerns a specific software system for use by the research community, then that software must be licensed with a recognized Open Source License, and be available for download, including source code, by a tar/zip file accessed through ftp/http or through a widely used version control system like cvs/subversion/git/bazaar/Mercurial.

See the following websites for further information:
* [http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ Recognized Open Source Licenses]
* [http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php Definition of the Open Source Philosophy]

== Open Bioinformatics Foundation Travel Fellowships ==

The [https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/blob/master/Travel_fellowships.md OBF Travel Fellowship program] is aimed at increasing diverse participation at events promoting open source bioinformatics software development and open science in the biological research community. The fellowship can be used to cover airfare, hotel and / or conference registration fees up to a value of USD 1,000. BOSC speakers are welcome to [https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/blob/master/Travel_fellowships.md apply for a fellowship]. The deadline for applying is April 15, 2018.
