Abstract submission this year will be via [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bosc2016 EasyChair].  You will need to register for an account on EasyChair in order to submit your abstract.   

The official deadline for submitting abstracts for BOSC talks will be '''April 1, 2016'''; however, we aim to keep a few spots saved for Late-Breaking Lightning Talks and posters. (There will also be a few spots reserved for walk-in posters; however, those will not be listed in the program or on the BOSC website.)
