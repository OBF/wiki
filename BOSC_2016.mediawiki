BOSC 2016 will take place '''July 8-9, 2016''', in Orlando, Florida, right before ISMB 2016.  
=== '''[[BOSC_Abstract_Submission|Submit your abstract now!]]'''  Abstracts due by April 1, 2016. ===
 
We plan to offer a limited number of [https://news.obf.io/2016/03/01/obf-travel-fellowship-program/ travel fellowships]  to help offset expenses for some accepted speakers who would not otherwise be able to attend BOSC. 

== Overview ==

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is run as a two-day meeting before the annual [http://www.iscb.org/ismb2016 ISMB conference]. It is sponsored by the [[Main_Page|Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)]], a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development and Open Science within the biological research community. 

Open Source software has flourished in the bioinformatics community for well over a decade. When the first BOSC was held in 2000, there were already many popular open source bioinformatics packages, and the number and range of these projects has increased dramatically since then. BOSC covers the wide range of open source bioinformatics software being developed, and encompasses the growing movement of Open Science, with its focus on transparency, reproducibility, and data provenance.  We welcome submissions relating to all aspects of bioinformatics and open science software, including new computational methods, reusable software components, visualization, interoperability, and other approaches that help to advance research in the biomolecular sciences. Two full days of talks, posters, panel discussions (see [[BOSC 2015 Schedule|schedule from BOSC 2015]]), and informal discussion groups (see [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yaSjWEZzwiAk6jUiKVk_pbmru1uCJuGbgITIyI3kmfI/edit# BOSC 2015 Birds-of-a-Feather notes]) will enable BOSC attendees to interact with other developers and share ideas and code, as well as learning about some of the latest developments in the field of open source bioinformatics.

We also organize a two-day community development session prior to the conference ([[Codefest 2016]]). This is an opportunity for anyone interested in open science, biology and programming to meet, discuss and work collaboratively. Everyone is welcome to attend Codefest (whether or not you attend BOSC).

Please spread the word about BOSC--all are welcome. On Twitter, [https://twitter.com/OBF_BOSC follow @OBF_BOSC] and use [https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BOSC2016 hash tag #bosc2016].

== Sponsors ==

BOSC is organised by the [[Main_Page|Open Bioinformatics Foundation]], a non-profit, volunteer-run group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development and Open Science within the biological research community.

We gratefully accept sponsorships from relevant private companies. These sponsorships enable us to offer free registration to some BOSC speakers to lower the financial barrier of their attendance.
If you would like to be a sponsor of BOSC, please contact us at at bosc@open-bio.org.

== Important Dates ==

* March 1, 2016: Call for [[BOSC_Abstract_Submission|one-page abstracts]] opens
* April 1, 2016: Deadline for submitting [[BOSC_Abstract_Submission|abstracts]]
* May 6, 2016: Authors notified
* [[Codefest 2016]]: July 6-7, 2016, Orlando, FL, USA at [https://familab.org/ FamiLAB]
* BOSC 2016: July 8-9, 2016, Orlando, FL, USA
* [https://www.iscb.org/ismb2016 ISMB 2016]: July 8-12,, 2016, Orlando, FL, USA

We plan to offer a limited number of travel fellowships to help offset expenses for some accepted speakers who would not otherwise be able to attend BOSC – please see the for more information. To be considered in time for BOSC, applications to this program are due for the April 15 deadline.

== Registration ==

Because BOSC is run as a two-day Special Interest Group (SIG) meeting at the annual ISMB conference, [https://www.iscb.org/ismb2016 registration is via ISMB 2016]. You can register for BOSC (which allows you to drop in on other SIGs as well), or register to attend the full ISMB/ECCB conference plus BOSC.

== Session Topics ==
We welcome submissions relating to all aspects of bioinformatics and open science software, including (but not limited to):
* '''Open Science and Reproducible Research''' -- covers the theory and practice of open science, including open notebook science, open data, transparent and reproducible workflows, and shared standards for reviewing and publishing research papers.
* '''Standards and Interoperability''' -- includes standards such as ontologies, formats, etc, as well as Open Source approaches to integrating the latest bioinformatics tools, exploring how we can increase tool connectivity and help communities work better together.
* '''Data Science''' -- encompasses software and approaches to managing, exploring, and analyzing large-scale data to address research questions, such as genome assembly, variant prediction, eQTL analysis, phylogenomics, and epigenetics.
* '''Visualization''' -- focuses on approaches for interactive as well as static visual representations of biomedical data, ranging from exploration to explanation.
* '''Translational Bioinformatics''' -- explores applications of biological and medical informatics to the development of personalized healthcare, therapies, and a better understanding of human health and disease. Topics include the analysis of large scale population and family sequencing data, bioinformatics methodologies for clinical research, and tools for discovering clinically useful associations in human databases.
* '''Bioinformatics Open Source Libraries and Projects''' -- features short talks from new or ongoing projects describing their recent progress. Abstracts will be solicited from open source projects affiliated with the OBF (see http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Projects), including the Bio* projects, DAS, BioMOBY, EMBOSS, and GMOD, but any other open-source project will be equally eligible to submit abstracts for this session.

== Keynote Speakers ==

This year's keynote speakers will be Jennifer Gardy (University of British Columbia / British Columbia Centre for Disease Control) and Steven Salzburg (Johns Hopkins University).
