=Anonymous access to the latest hosted source code repositories=

The methods described here grant access to live snapshots of our current code repositories. The files may be in constant flux and certainly do not reflect official packages and supported releases. 

The following OBF supported projects are now using git hosted on [http://github.com github.com]:

    * [http://www.bioruby.org BioRuby] uses http://github.com/bioruby/bioruby
    * [http://www.biopython.org Biopython] uses http://github.com/biopython/biopython
    * [http://www.bioperl.org BioPerl] uses http://github.com/bioperl
    * [http://www.biosql.org BioSQL] uses http://github.com/biosql/biosql

For downloads of tested and released software, please visit the official [[Projects]] page for links to the project websites and download locations.

== Note to developers ==

This page describes methods for obtaining '''read only''' access to the latest snapshots of our source code. Updates, fixes and new code '''can not''' be committed, but you can create a [https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo fork] of the repository on github (allowing you to modify you own personal repository), and changes resubmitted to the projects as a [https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/ pull request].

== Past archives ==

The above projects have previously used CVS and/or SVN hosted on OBF-maintained hardware, but these resources are no longer available.
