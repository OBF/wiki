### Madeleine Ball

[Madeleine Ball](http://www.madeleineball.net/) is Executive Director of
Open Humans Foundation and co-founder of Open Humans, a nonprofit
project enabling individuals to engage studies and share data.

[Open Humans](https://www.openhumans.org/) is an open source online
platform and community, created through funding support from the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.
Open Humans enables members to connect data from a variety of sources,
including genome, microbiome, activity tracking, and GPS data â€“ and then
invites members to share their data with projects and work with research
studies. By using an individual-centered approach, Open Humans enables
new research opportunities, including: data sharing by individuals,
cohort sharing across studies, anonymous engagement with studies, and
citizen-led projects.

Dr. Ball is also supported by a [Shuttleworth Foundation
Fellowship](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/about/), supporting her
continued vision for new approaches to openness in human health research
and data sharing. Previously, Dr. Ball was Director of Research at the
[Harvard Personal Genome
Project](http://www.personalgenomes.org/harvard/).

Dr. Ball's keynote talk topic is "*Open Sourcing Ourselves*"
([slides](https://f1000research.com/slides/6-1255),
[video](https://youtu.be/PXBxZCfvMXI),
[transcript](http://www.madeleineball.net/open-sourcing-ourselves/)).

Dr. Ball will also be one of the panelists for our panel on [ Open
Data--Standards, Opportunities and
Challenges](BOSC_2017_Panel "wikilink").

### Nick Loman

[Nick Loman](http://lab.loman.net/about/) is known as a vocal proponent
of open genomic data in healthcare. A Professor of Microbial Genomics
and Bioinformatics at the University of Birmingham, Dr. Loman explores
the use of cutting-edge genomics and metagenomics approaches to human
pathogens. He promotes the use of open data to facilitate the
surveillance and treatment of infectious disease.

Dr. Loman helped establish real-time genomic surveillance of Ebola in
Guinea and Zika in Brazil (via the [ZiBRA
project](http://www.zibraproject.org/), which states that "Data will be
subject to open release as it is generated"). In another recent project,
real-time genomic data was used to analyze a small outbreak of
Salmonella enteritidis in the UK. Through this sharing of genomic
datasets, researchers were able to confirm that the cases were linked to
a larger, national-scale outbreak. Dr. Loman is one of the authors of
[Poretools](https://poretools.readthedocs.io/), and he regularly shares
cutting-edge Nanopore data and protocols for using it. In collaboration
with Lex Nederbragt, Dr. Loman is developing an open-source repository
of sequencing and bioinformatics benchmarking datasets called
[Seqbench](http://lab.loman.net/high-throughput%20sequencing/e.%20coli%20o104%20h4/genomics/2012/10/09/seqbench-a-useful-meta-resource-of-e-coli-sequence-reads/).

Dr. Loman's talk title is "*Open data meets ubiquitous sequencing:
challenges and opportunities*"
([slides](https://f1000research.com/slides/6-1266),
[video](https://youtu.be/6QmITGqDvjQ)).

Dr. Loman will also be one of the panelists for our panel on [ Open
Data--Standards, Opportunities and
Challenges](BOSC_2017_Panel "wikilink").
