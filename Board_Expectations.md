Board members are expected to actively contribute to steering the OBF to
help it accomplish its stated missions and objectives. This includes:

- Participate in the (informal) regular meetings of Board members.
  Meetings are currently about 1 hour, once a month, held by Google
  Hangout. These meetings are for communicating and discussing current
  OBF operations and issues, as well as brainstorming strategic
  directions and initiatives.
- Participate in public Board meetings, including voting in elections
  and on matters brought before the OBF Board for approval. Public Board
  meetings take place 1-2 times a year via conference call, are about 1
  hour in duration, and are usually scheduled in place of a Board
  hangout.
- Help promote the causes and objectives of the OBF, as set and approved
  by the Board, such as lobbying funders, employers, and other decision
  makers in your network about these objectives and ways to achieve
  them, as well as promoting the causes of the OBF at community
  gatherings you attend.
- Contribute to identifying strategies, opportunities, and mechanisms to
  better sustain the OBF, to grow its member communities, and to
  increase its overall diversity, including demographic diversity.
