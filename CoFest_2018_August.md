August 2018 CollaborationFest (CoFest) is a **distributed online event
on August 17th, 2018**. Initiated by [Bérénice
Batut](http://bebatut.fr/) and [Saskia
Hiltemann](https://twitter.com/shiltemann) of the Galaxy Training
Network, this is a distributed online event meant to continue the work
from the [GCCBOSC 2018
CollaborationFest](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gccbosc2018/collaboration/).
This is a more informal event than our larger scale events, and the
first attempt at having regular online collaboration days. In Boston,
we'll be working together in a room in the Longwood Medical Area if
anyone wants to join. We'll have space, power, wifi and friendly people
to work with.

## What is CoFest?

CollaborationFests (or CoFests, for short) are in person or online
working sessions aimed at developing open source code, documentation,
training materials and anything else useful for doing biological
research and analysis on the computer. The event is no cost and everyone
who has the time and interest in working collaboratively for a day is
welcome, regardless of experience. We love having new community members.

CoFest is structured differently than traditional conferences:

- It's a working session, so there won't be formal talks or training.
  The day is structured around group discussion, coding and writing.
- Community members self organize around projects of interest. Everyone
  is encouraged to suggest projects, and then groups form around those
  projects.
- We aim to work collaboratively, you are always welcome to change
  groups or try and connect work happening in different groups.
- We informally share our working goals and progress at multiple times
  during the day, normally morning, lunchtime and at the end of the work
  day. This helps community members find work on interest and
  connections between different groups.
- We want your feedback, suggestions and ideas to structure the day.

## Finding work to do

We have a [shared document with current project ideas for this
CoFest](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_IKEw1UPF6pfSBaJB9xOl-o-oVincZdKEk95NaRf7Fo/edit?usp=sharing).
Bring your projects and ideas, we want to hear them. You can also take
inspiration from previous working groups:

## Logistics

We'll have a shared online presence in this BlueJeans room:

<https://bluejeans.com/106872911/>

And the Galaxy Training Network will have an open Hangout room:

<https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/calendar/Z2FsYXh5dW5pZnJlaWJ1cmdAZ21haWwuY29t.55dck65etnslp0av1tmk0hgre2?authuser=1>

That's the main place to join and discuss and we can create additional
purpose specific rooms as needed. Between the 2 sites we'll have
coverage online between 2am EST to 5pm EST so hopefully can overlap with
most time zones for part of that. If any other groups would like to be
in charge of the channel for other times outside of this, please speak
up.

We'll plan to have all group discussions to join:

- 10am CEST (08:00 GMT/UTC, 4am EDT) Google Hangouts (Galaxy Training
  Network)
- 9:30am EDT (13:30 GMT/UTC, 3:30pm CEST) Blue Jeans room (General)
- 10am EDT (14:00 GMT/UTC, 4pm CEST) Google Hangouts (Galaxy Training
  Network)
- 12:30pm EDT (16:30 GMT/UTC, 6:30pm CEST) Blue Jeans room (General)
- 4pm EDT (20:00 GMT/UTC, 10pm CEST) Blue Jeans room (General)

And can schedule more of these if any groups want to volunteer to lead
at non-EST friendly times.
