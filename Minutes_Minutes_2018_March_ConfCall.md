## New business

Hilmar welcomed B and Y and asked them to introduce themselves.

- Term expirations and Elections for the Board (electronic ballot)
- Introduction - Bastian Greshake Tzovaras, running for Board member
  at-large
  - Many many different open-source/science projects (OpenSNP is only
    one)
  - Mozilla!
  - Would like to get the OBF name out there, be more
- Introduction - Yo Yehudi, running for Board member at-large
  - Intermine
  - Open Science - increase open source in open science
  - Also involved with Mozilla
  - SSI fellow this year
  - Outreachy - not just GSoC but WiS, increasing diversity
- We have quorum for voting
  - 6/6 votes for Bastian and 6/6 votes for Yo! Congrats to both!
  - Action on Hilmar to add them to the Board mailing list etc.
- Fiscal sponsor - experiences, lessons, possibilities
  - Our fiscal sponsor is SPI (https://spi-inc.org).
    - Dissolved our own incorporation and became an SPI associated
      project in 2012
      (https://news.open-bio.org/2012/10/12/obf-now-spi-associated/).
    - Having a fiscal sponsor allows us to receive tax-exempt donations
      (501(c)3 in the US), without having to spend the effort of
      obtaining and maintaining our own 501(c)3 non-profit status.
    - One of the reasons we chose SPI over others was the good cultural
      fit (SPI is relatively hands-off) and tie-in with Debian-based
      bioinformatics community efforts (DebianMed).
  - Encountered a number of pain points over the years
    - Financial reporting is behind and slow
    - Travel fellowships generally come from BOSC account - pretty quick
    - Other reimbursements from SPI generally take longer
    - Lack of financial reporting sometimes for extended periods of
      time, which makes it difficult to verify receipt of sponsorship
      commitments, for example.
    - Transferring some of our domain name assets to SPI did not go
      smoothly, many delays. Sysadmin side of SPI is too slow and
      unresponsive to be considered functional.
    - AWS billing on someone’s personal credit card (and reimbursing
      later) is a high risk for the individual.
  - There are more alternatives now than there were back in 2012. This
    might be a good time to consider their pros and cons.
    - OpenCollective <https://opencollective.com/>
      - Application form
      - Yo came across OpenCollective for a project of her own. Very
        attractive, but need \>100 stars. Several OBF Bio\* projects
        would fit this.
    - NumFOCUS, Community Initiatives <http://communityin.org/>
      - The joint Carpentries just moved from NumFOCUS to Community
        Initiatives. See blog post:
        <https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2018/01/fiscal-sponsor-transition.html>
      - We probably don’t fit the annual budget and revenue size that CI
        is looking for in their fiscally sponsored projects.
      - NumFOCUS fiscally sponsors many projects that tie into our
        community and mission. Much of what motivated the Carpentries to
        move probably doesn’t apply to OBF.
  - SPI community includes associated projects that are similar to us,
    and hence should still be a good fit. The challenges seem to be
    precipitated by SPI not having paid staff, hence little to no
    accountability for meeting service level standards.

## Any other business?

- H3ABionet interaction - promotion of open science and open source
  across Africa

**Hilmar moves to adjourn meeting at 11.51am EDT, 15:51 UTC. Peter
