== Open Data: Standards, Opportunities and Challenges ==

Every year, BOSC includes a panel discussion that offers attendees the chance to engage in conversation with the panelists and each other. This year, our panel discussion will focus on open data: how it can help to catalyze scientific and preserve knowledge, standards for sharing data, and some of the challenges (for example, protecting privacy of human health data).
