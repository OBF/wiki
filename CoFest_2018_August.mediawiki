---

August 2018 CollaborationFest (CoFest) is a distributed online event on August 17th, 2018. Initiated by Bérénice Batut and Saskia Hiltemann of the Galaxy Training Network, this is a distributed online event meant to continue the work from the [https://galaxyproject.org/events/gccbosc2018/collaboration/ GCCBOSC 2018 CollaborationFest]. This is a more informal event that our larger scale events, and the first attempt at having regular online collaboration days. In Boston, we'll be working together in a room in the Longwood Medical Area if anyone wants to join. We'll have space, power, wifi and friendly people to work with.
