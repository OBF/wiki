=== Madeleine Ball ===

[http://www.madeleineball.net/ Madeleine Ball] is Executive Director of Open Humans Foundation and co-founder of Open Humans, a nonprofit project enabling individuals to engage studies and share data.

[https://www.openhumans.org/ Open Humans] is an open source online platform and community, created through funding support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. Open Humans enables members to connect data from a variety of sources, including genome, microbiome, activity tracking, and GPS data â€“ and then invites members to share their data with projects and work with research studies. By using an individual-centered approach, Open Humans enables new research opportunities, including: data sharing by individuals, cohort sharing across studies, anonymous engagement with studies, and citizen-led projects.

Dr. Ball is also supported by a [https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/about/ Shuttleworth Foundation Fellowship], supporting her continued vision for new approaches to openness in human health research and data sharing. Previously, Dr. Ball was Director of Research at the [http://www.personalgenomes.org/harvard/ Harvard Personal Genome Project].

Dr. Ball's keynote talk topic is "''Open Sourcing Ourselves''" ([https://f1000research.com/slides/6-1255 slides], [https://youtu.be/PXBxZCfvMXI video]).

Dr. Ball will also be one of the panelists for our panel on [[BOSC_2017_Panel| Open Data--Standards, Opportunities and Challenges]].

=== Nick Loman ===

[http://lab.loman.net/about/ Nick Loman] is known as a vocal proponent of open genomic data in healthcare. A Professor of Microbial Genomics and Bioinformatics at the University of Birmingham, Dr. Loman explores the use of cutting-edge genomics and metagenomics approaches to human pathogens. He promotes the use of open data to facilitate the surveillance and treatment of infectious disease.

Dr. Loman helped establish real-time genomic surveillance of Ebola in Guinea and Zika in Brazil (via the [http://www.zibraproject.org/ ZiBRA project], which states that "Data will be subject to open release as it is generated"). In another recent project, real-time genomic data was used to analyze a small outbreak of Salmonella enteritidis in the UK. Through this sharing of genomic datasets, researchers were able to confirm that the cases were linked to a larger, national-scale outbreak. Dr. Loman is one of the authors of [https://poretools.readthedocs.io/ Poretools], and he regularly shares cutting-edge Nanopore data and protocols for using it. In collaboration with Lex Nederbragt, Dr. Loman is developing an open-source repository of sequencing and bioinformatics benchmarking datasets called [http://lab.loman.net/high-throughput%20sequencing/e.%20coli%20o104%20h4/genomics/2012/10/09/seqbench-a-useful-meta-resource-of-e-coli-sequence-reads/ Seqbench].

Dr. Loman's talk title is "''Open data meets ubiquitous sequencing: challenges and opportunities''" ([https://f1000research.com/slides/6-1266 slides], [https://youtu.be/6QmITGqDvjQ video]).

Dr. Loman will also be one of the panelists for our panel on [[BOSC_2017_Panel| Open Data--Standards, Opportunities and Challenges]].
