=== Dawn Field ===

Dawn Field is a Lamberg International Guest Professor at Göteborg University’s Department of Marine Sciences. Previously she was a senior research fellow at the NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Head of the Molecular Evolution and Bioinformatics Group at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Wallingford, UK, and a research associate at the Smithsonian Institution. She is also a founder of the Genomic Standards Consortium, the Genomic Observatories Network and Ocean Sampling Day.

Dr. Field is credited with introducing the concept of a biological code, or “biocode"--the sum of all DNA on earth. In their book [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/biocode-9780199687756 Biocode: The New Age of Genomics], she and coauthor Neil Davies describe the rapid rise of genomics, how it is revealing the scale and diversity of life on Earth, and future possibilities and implications. 

Dr. Field's advocacy for open data and interoperability is epitomized by her past leadership of the Genomics Standards Consortium ([http://gensc.org/about-gsc/ GSC]), which aims to facilitate genomic data integration, discovery and comparison through international community-driven standards.

The title of Dr. Field's keynote talk is "Understanding the Biocode: Global Sharing of Data."

=== Nick Loman ===

[http://lab.loman.net/about/ Nick Loman] is known as a vocal proponent of open genomic data in healthcare. A Professor of Microbial Genomics and Bioinformatics at the University of Birmingham, Dr. Loman explores the use of cutting-edge genomics and metagenomics approaches to human pathogens. He promotes the use of open data to facilitate the surveillance and treatment of infectious disease.

Dr. Loman helped establish real-time genomic surveillance of Ebola in Guinea and Zika in Brazil (via the [http://www.zibraproject.org/ ZiBRA project], which states that "Data will be subject to open release as it is generated"). In another recent project, real-time genomic data was used to analyze a small outbreak of Salmonella enteritidis in the UK. Through this sharing of genomic datasets, researchers were able to confirm that the cases were linked to a larger, national-scale outbreak. Dr. Loman is one of the authors of [https://poretools.readthedocs.io/ Poretools], and he regularly shares cutting-edge Nanopore data and protocols for using it. In collaboration with Lex Nederbragt, Dr. Loman is developing an open-source repository of sequencing and bioinformatics benchmarking datasets called [http://lab.loman.net/high-throughput%20sequencing/e.%20coli%20o104%20h4/genomics/2012/10/09/seqbench-a-useful-meta-resource-of-e-coli-sequence-reads/ Seqbench].

Dr. Loman's talk title is "Open data meets ubiquitous sequencing: challenges and opportunities."

Dr. Loman will also be one of the panelists for our panel on [[BOSC_2017_Panel| Open Data--Standards, Opportunities and Challenges]].
