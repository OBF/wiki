The 18th Annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2017) was held '''July 22-23, 2017 in Prague''' as part of the new combined [https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017 ISMB/ECCB meeting] to be held July 21-25, 2017.

== Summaries of BOSC 2017 ==



== Overview ==

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is organized by the [https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Main_Page Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)], a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of open source software development and open science within the biological research community. Since its inception in 2000, BOSC has provided a forum for developers and users to interact and share research results and ideas in open source bioinformatics. BOSC’s broad spectrum of topics includes practical techniques for solving bioinformatics problems; software development practices; standards and ontologies; approaches that promote open science and sharing of data, results and software; and ways to grow open source communities while promoting diversity within them.

We also organize a [[Codefest]], a two-day community development session, usually just before or after BOSC. This is an opportunity for anyone interested in open science, biology and programming to meet, discuss and work collaboratively. Everyone is welcome to attend [[Codefest 2017]] (whether or not you attend BOSC).

Please spread the word about BOSC--all are welcome. On Twitter, [https://twitter.com/OBF_BOSC follow @OBF_BOSC] and use [https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BOSC2017 hash tag #bosc2017].

* July 21-25: Combined [https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017 ISMB/ECCB meeting]
* '''July 22-23, 2017: BOSC 2017, Prague'''

== Session Topics ==
BOSC covers all aspects of bioinformatics and open science software, including (but not limited to):
* Open Science and Reproducible Research
* Open Biomedical Data
* Citizen/Participatory Science
* Standards and Interoperability
* Data Science
* Workflows
* Visualization
* Medical and Translational Bioinformatics
* Developer Tools and Libraries
* Bioinformatics Open Source Project Progress Reports
* [[BOSC_2017_Panel|PANEL: Open Data--Standards, Opportunities and Challenges]]

== Keynote Speakers ==

This year's keynote speakers will be Nick Loman (University of Birmingham), a vocal proponent of open genomic data in healthcare who heads the Zibra project, and Madeleine Ball (Open Humans), who is dedicated to opening human health data.

== Registration ==

To attend BOSC 2017, you need to register for [https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017-registration ISMB/ECCB 2017]. You can register for the full meeting (July 21-25) or just the first two full days (July 22-23).

In the past, BOSC has taken place the two days before ISMB as a Special Interest Group (SIG). This year, ISMB is trying a new structure: the SIGs (now called Communities of Special Interest, or COSIs) are integrated into the main ISMB meeting. BOSC will take place the first two full days of ISMB (July 22-23). BOSC attendees can register for the full ISMB/ECCB meeting (July 21-25) or for just two days (there is no single-day registration option this year). Note that the pricing structure is designed to encourage participants to join ISCB, as this saves you money overall.

If you choose the July 22-23 option, this includes the opening ISMB reception and keynote the evening of July 21. As in past years, you will be able to move freely between all of the COSIs that take place during the days for which you register.

== Sponsors ==

BOSC is organised by the [[Main_Page|Open Bioinformatics Foundation]], a non-profit, volunteer-run group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development and Open Science within the biological research community.
