BOSC 2017 will be held July 24-25, 2017 in Prague as part of the new combined [https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017 ISMB/EECB/COSI meeting] to be held July 21-25, 2017.

== Overview ==

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is organized by the [https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Main_Page Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)], a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of open source software development and open science within the biological research community. Since its inception in 2000, BOSC has provided a forum for developers and users to interact and share research results and ideas in open source bioinformatics. BOSC’s broad spectrum of topics includes practical techniques for solving bioinformatics problems; software development practices; standards and ontologies; approaches that promote open science and sharing of data, results and software; and ways to grow open source communities while promoting diversity within them.

We also organize Codefest, a two-day community development session, just before or after BOSC ([[Codefest 2016]]). This is an opportunity for anyone interested in open science, biology and programming to meet, discuss and work collaboratively. Everyone is welcome to attend Codefest (whether or not you attend BOSC).

Please spread the word about BOSC--all are welcome. On Twitter, [https://twitter.com/OBF_BOSC follow @OBF_BOSC] and use [https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BOSC2017 hash tag #bosc2017].
