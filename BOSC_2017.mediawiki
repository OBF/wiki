The 18th Annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2017) will take place July 22-23, 2017 in Prague as part of the new combined [https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017 ISMB/ECCB meeting] to be held July 21-25, 2017.

=== * * * [[BOSC_Abstract_Submission|Abstract submission]]  is now open! * * * ===

== Overview ==

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is organized by the [https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Main_Page Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)], a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of open source software development and open science within the biological research community. Since its inception in 2000, BOSC has provided a forum for developers and users to interact and share research results and ideas in open source bioinformatics. BOSC’s broad spectrum of topics includes practical techniques for solving bioinformatics problems; software development practices; standards and ontologies; approaches that promote open science and sharing of data, results and software; and ways to grow open source communities while promoting diversity within them.

We also organize a [[Codefest]], a two-day community development session, usually just before or after BOSC. This is an opportunity for anyone interested in open science, biology and programming to meet, discuss and work collaboratively. Everyone is welcome to attend [[Codefest 2017]] (whether or not you attend BOSC).

Please spread the word about BOSC--all are welcome. On Twitter, [https://twitter.com/OBF_BOSC follow @OBF_BOSC] and use [https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BOSC2017 hash tag #bosc2017].

== Important Dates ==

Note this year all the SIG/COSI meetings at ISMB/ECCB are trying to use consistent abstract deadlines dates, and these have yet to be confirmed.

* March 6, 2017: [[BOSC_Abstract_Submission|Abstract submission]] opens
* April 3, 2017: [https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017-registration ISMB/ECCB online registration] opens (see notes below)
* April 13, 2017: '''Deadline for [[BOSC_Abstract_Submission|submitting abstracts]] for full talks''' (there will be a later deadline for late-breaking lightning talks and posters)
* July 20-21, 2017: [[Codefest 2017]], Prague (location TBD)
* July 21-25: Combined [https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017 ISMB/ECCB meeting]
* '''July 22-23, 2017: BOSC 2017, Prague'''

== Session Topics ==
We welcome submissions relating to all aspects of bioinformatics and open science software, including (but not limited to):
* Open Science and Reproducible Research
* Open Biomedical Data
* Citizen/Participatory Science
* Standards and Interoperability
* Data Science
* Workflows
* Visualization
* Medical and Translational Bioinformatics
* Developer Tools and Libraries
* Bioinformatics Open Source Project Progress Reports

== Registration ==

[https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017-registration BOSC 2017 registration is via ISMB/ECCB 2017]. In the past, BOSC has taken place the two days before ISMB as a Special Interest Group (SIG). This year, ISMB is trying a new structure: the SIGs (now called COSIs) are integrated into the main ISMB meeting. BOSC will take place the first two full days of ISMB (July 22-23). Attendees will have the option to register for the full ISMB/ECCB meeting (July 21-25) or for just two days (there is no single-day registration option this year). Note that the pricing structure is designed to encourage participants to join ISCB, as this saves you money overall.

If you choose the July 22-23 option, this will include BOSC (as well as allowing you to move freely between the other COSIs that are scheduled for those two days) and also the opening ISMB reception and keynote the evening of July 21.

== Sponsors ==

BOSC is organised by the [[Main_Page|Open Bioinformatics Foundation]], a non-profit, volunteer-run group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development and Open Science within the biological research community.

We gratefully accept sponsorships from relevant private companies. These sponsorships enable us to offer free registration to some BOSC speakers to help increase diversity at our meeting.
