**[BOSC 2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) was held June 26-27,
2018** (with training days June 24-25 and a CollaborationFest June
28-29) at Reed College in Portland, Oregon as part of [the GCCBOSC 2018
bioinformatics community conference](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/)
co-hosted with the Galaxy Community Conference. Check out the [complete
schedule](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/)!'''

We thank GCC co-chairs Dave Clements and Nicole Vasilevsky for all their
contributions to making GCCBOSC 2018 a success!

## Why is BOSC partnering with GCC in 2018?

<img src="Gcc-bosc-2018-logo_boxed_300.png" title="GCCBOSC 2018"
width="100" alt="GCCBOSC 2018" /> BOSC has been a part of
[ISMB](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2018) since its inception, and we
greatly value our relationships with the ISCB management and the ISMB
community. [BOSC 2017](BOSC_2017 "wikilink"), which was part of
[ISMB/ECCB 2017](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2017) in Prague, was an
exciting and successful meeting.

Because of our continuing focus on [broadening and deepening the BOSC
community](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/blob/master/Travel_fellowships.md),
we've been exploring ways to reach those in the bioinformatics community
who aren’t already part of the audience attracted by ISMB. As part of
that exploration, we have looked at other organizations and conferences
that have been successful at establishing a strong and growing community
of participants. One such conference is the [Galaxy Community Conference
(GCC)](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/).

After much discussion and planning, we'll be participating in a
[bioinformatics community conference](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) in
2018 that includes both GCC and BOSC. We hope this will help serve the
open bioinformatics community in a few ways:

- It creates a conference with an explicit focus on development, support
  and maintenance of the interoperable software tools and libraries that
  enable modern scientific research. We believe the only sustainable way
  to provide the infrastructure needed for high throughput analyses is
  to build cooperating, open, diverse communities of programmers and
  biologists. This conference is where we hope to build and deepen this
  community.

<!-- -->

- It includes two dedicated training days by members from both the [Open
  Bioinformatics Foundation](https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Main_Page)
  and Galaxy communities. This enables focused training on useful tools
  and approaches, making the conference attractive to anyone who wants
  to expand their skills.

<!-- -->

- There will be integrated collaboration days after the conference,
  merging [BOSC Codefest](https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Codefest_2017)
  and [Galaxy's Developer and User Hackathon
  Days](https://gcc2017.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/10). We hope
  the integrated collaboration days following training and the
  conference talks will allow new and existing members of the community
  to attend and build working relationships.

<!-- -->

- The meeting will be held at a great venue in Portland--Reed
  College--providing an affordable and fun experience for anyone who
  wants to attend.

We would like to emphasize that this is an experiment for us and we
aren’t looking to sever our strong ties with ISMB. We're planning to
evaluate the combined GCC and BOSC experience in 2018 and welcome
community feedback on all of these thoughts and plans.
