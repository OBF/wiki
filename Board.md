## Joining the Board

According to the bylaws, "*Nominations for the Board of Directors may be
made by the general membership at any time throughout the year by email
to any Board Member.*" (see Art. IV.1) The Board tries on an ongoing
basis to create opportunities for members of the community to serve,
while also ensuring stability of the Board. Opportunities for filling a
seat, either through expansion of the Board, or by replacing a Board
member whose term expires, arise in most years, and the Board is always
interested to hear from volunteers from the community interested in
serving.

Please see general [expectations for Board
members](Board/Expectations "wikilink").

*The Nominating Committee, which used to be described here until
recently, no longer exists as a fixed entity. It was removed in the [Oct
2016 revisions to the Bylaws](https://github.com/OBF/obf-docs/pull/28).*
