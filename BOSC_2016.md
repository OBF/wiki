## Overview

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is run as a two-day
meeting before the annual [ISMB
conference](http://www.iscb.org/ismb2016). It is organized by the [Open
Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF)](Main_Page "wikilink"), a non-profit
group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source
software development and Open Science within the biological research
community.

Open Source software has flourished in the bioinformatics community for
well over a decade. When the first BOSC was held in 2000, there were
already many popular open source bioinformatics packages, and the number
and range of these projects has increased dramatically since then. BOSC
covers the wide range of open source bioinformatics software being
developed, and encompasses the growing movement of Open Science, with
its focus on transparency, reproducibility, and data provenance. We
welcome submissions relating to all aspects of bioinformatics and open
science software, including new computational methods, reusable software
components, visualization, interoperability, and other approaches that
help to advance research in the biomolecular sciences. Two full days of
talks, posters, panel discussions (see the [BOSC 2016
Schedule](BOSC_2016_Schedule "wikilink")), and informal discussion
groups (see [BOSC 2016 Birds-of-a-Feather
notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zKSzP4_6_ezVw1g4Igy8ZRdFDBJ268uMy_5LKA98Mc0/edit#))
will enable BOSC attendees to interact with other developers and share
ideas and code, as well as learning about some of the latest
developments in the field of open source bioinformatics.

We also organize a two-day community development session prior to the
conference ([Codefest 2016](Codefest_2016 "wikilink")). This is an
opportunity for anyone interested in open science, biology and
programming to meet, discuss and work collaboratively. Everyone is
welcome to attend Codefest (whether or not you attend BOSC).

Please spread the word about BOSC--all are welcome. On Twitter, [follow
@OBF_BOSC](https://twitter.com/OBF_BOSC) and use [hash tag
\#bosc2016](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BOSC2016).

We thank [Curoverse](http://curoverse.com) (the team behind the open
source platform [Arvados](http://arvados.org)) as returning sponsors.

We gratefully accept sponsorships from relevant private companies. These
sponsorships enable us to offer free registration to some BOSC speakers
to lower the financial barrier of their attendance.

If you would like to be a sponsor of BOSC, please contact us at
bosc@open-bio.org.

## Important Dates

- April 4, 2016: Deadline for submitting
  [abstracts](BOSC_Abstract_Submission "wikilink") for full talks
- June 2, 2016: End of early
  [registration](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2016-registration) discount
  for ISMB/BOSC

## Registration

Because BOSC is run as a two-day Special Interest Group (SIG) meeting at
the annual ISMB conference, [registration is via ISMB
2016](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2016). You can register for BOSC (which
allows you to drop in on other SIGs as well), or register to attend the
full ISMB/ECCB conference plus BOSC.

## Session Topics

We welcome submissions relating to all aspects of bioinformatics and
open science software, including (but not limited to):

- **Open Science and Reproducible Research** -- covers the theory and
  practice of open science, including open notebook science, open data,
  transparent and reproducible workflows, and shared standards for
  reviewing and publishing research papers.
- **Standards and Interoperability** -- includes standards such as
  ontologies, formats, etc, as well as Open Source approaches to
  integrating the latest bioinformatics tools, exploring how we can
  increase tool connectivity and help communities work better together.
- **Data Science** -- encompasses software and approaches to managing,
  exploring, and analyzing large-scale data to address research
  questions, such as genome assembly, variant prediction, eQTL analysis,
  phylogenomics, and epigenetics.
- **Workflows** -- focuses on standardized representations and exchange
  formats for workflows (such as Common Workflow Language) and tools for
  creating, editing and running workflows.
- **Developer Tools and Libraries** -- includes Bio\* libraries such as
  Biopython, and tools to help developers install or maintain analysis
  packages, configure web-based services, store and exchange metadata,
  etc.
- [**Panel: Growing and sustaining open source
  communities**](BOSC_2016_Panel "wikilink")

## Keynote Speakers

This year's keynote speakers will be Jennifer Gardy (University of
British Columbia / British Columbia Centre for Disease Control) and
Steven Salzberg (Johns Hopkins University).
